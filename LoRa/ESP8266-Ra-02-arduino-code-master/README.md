# 15$ LoRa Gateway/Node ESP8266 Build PCB

Video tutorial : https://youtu.be/wcAqpmt9OTs

This Project/Circuit is a single channel gateway of LoRa, You can use this PCB as a node as well. The project uses:

1) ESP8266 as the microcontroller
2) Ra-02 LoRa module.
3) OLED SSD13086 0.96' display
4) Other basic components.
There is also an easy to program header under the OLED display to flash the device by connecting FTDI chip.
